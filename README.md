# Battleships (Game Server)

![Lifecycle Archived](https://badgen.net/badge/Lifecycle/Archived/grey)

This is a game server that powers our yearly Intern Competition and other hackathons. 

## The Game 

The game is Battleships, but with the added twists of maps that are generated with islands, and an additional ship type. Players write (AI or other) algorithms that must find and sink opponent ships.

## Pre-requisites

This server must run alongside the Socialgorithm [Tournament Server](https://github.com/socialgorithm/tournament-server). Players can start from and improve example players that play at random:

* [JavaScript Starter Player](https://github.com/Morgan-Stanley/battleships-player-js)
* [Python Starter Player](https://github.com/Morgan-Stanley/battleships-player-python)

## Running

To run the server:

```js
npm install
npm run start
```

For more information, please view the [Socialgorithm docs](https://socialgorithm.org/docs)
